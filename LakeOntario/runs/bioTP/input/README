this package contains the following for the Lake Ontario Operational Forecast System (LOOFS):
	-grid files
	-namelists
	-meteorological forcing* for 2018-01-01 thru 2018-12-30 (last day omitted)
	-EXAMPLE river forcing for 8 months in 2022 (b/c data not readily available in 2018)

these files were generated for NOAA GLERL's experimental GLCFS and should be compatible
with FVCOM version 4.3.1 (available at github.com/FVCOM-GitHub/FVCOM/releases/tag/release-v4.3.1)

The make.inc file is also included to indicate the compile-time options we set.
(many settings will be specific to our HPC but some are physics-related)

*the met forcing is NOT interpolated onto the unstructured grid but instead formatted in
such a way that FVCOM can read it in directly and do on-the-fly interpolation when the model runs
