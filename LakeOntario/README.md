Excuse the mess, FVCOM 4.4.2 doesn't allow data files to be held in higher level folders, so the inputs folder has to be the same level as the runs

Lake Ontario TP modeling
- input- data sources to be shared between users
- Lake Ontario 2018
	- FVCOM (4.4.2)
	- linked TP biological model

- [run](LakeErie/run.md) - notes for compiling and running on Expanse at SDSC
- [submit.sh](LakeErie/submit.sh) - SLURM batch script for Expanse

**data**
- [TP_ZOO_Loads.csv](LakeErie/data/TP_ZOO_Loads.csv): Phosphorus loading, including Zooplankton component

**scripts**

Other Notes:

- For VisIt, comparing with LEEM:
```
DefineScalarExpression("TP_tot", "RPOP + LPOP + RDOP + LDOP + PO4T + LPIP + RPIP + (ZOO1 + ZOO2 + ZOO3)/50.0")
```
